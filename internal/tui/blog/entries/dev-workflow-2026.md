# Neovim was the catalyst
> 02-12-26

It’s been years since the last time I wrote something and genuinely felt the need to immortalize the experience I had. Not to exaggerate, but neovim has truly been life changing.

Back in the day, I used to get overwhelmed with GUI clients i.e., for databases, so I tried and made the switch to terminal. Long story short, the same transition happened with Git, Maven, package managers, and more. 

Looking back on nearly a decade of professional experience, it’s probably been 8 years since I last installed a GUI client for those tools. Now, it happened again this time with the IDEs I’ve grown so used to.

Story time. I’ve been using JetBrains (IntelliJ) for the longest time through out my career working with Spring projects. It’s just that good tbh, and I believe you can’t wrong with it. Oddly enough (or maybe as common as it can be), I default to using VS code when working with languages other than Java. It’s not my first time trying neovim. In fact, I once gave up on it and ended up installing vim motions in my go-to IDEs. 

Fast forward to January 2026. I decided to give it another shot and really put it to the test by actually using it at work (I know. Crazy.)

I wish I could say I delivered the requirement faster than ever, but far from it, SKILL ISSUE hit me hard). I had to quickly abort the mission and switch back to IntelliJ, and prioritize the product requirements. 

While it obviously didn’t go as planned, I realized something very important, and that is how reliant I had become on IntelliJ, and how much I had been taking IDE features for granted.

A huge part of coding in an IDE had become muscIe memory for me and I guess getting so caught up with work, life, and any shenanigans in between throughout the years made me so numb. Thankfully, that single experience alone made me appreciate those little things again. It rekindled a tiny ember in me, to setup an editor I can consider my own. 

With me on an IDE, I watched myself code as if I were on a third person POV, and without being on auto pilot, I managed to gradually spot things I need and set those up in neovim (even learned a bit of lua in the process).

So the next day, I tried putting it to the test again. I really wished I could say it was different this time, but no, it turns out setting up neovim for Java isn’t the most straightforward process. It took me two weeks to have a decent setup. Enough that I can go days without IntelliJ (unless I had to restructure or repackage quite a lot of modules)

In any case, I’ve made peace that the goal isn’t even to completely not use an IDE, but as with anything, to use the right tool for the job. And as for me, neovim gives me much better autonomy over my workflow, which was the catalyst that led to my current setup with TMUX + Git Worktrees.

I now use neovim as my daily driver, *by the way*, and I’d say it made a better developer.
