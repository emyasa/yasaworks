interface(1)

**NAME**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Yasaworks LLC** - a single-member limited liability company
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emmanuel Yasa, Managing Member

**SYNOPSIS**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Yasaworks LLC [Operating Principles & Process]**

**DESCRIPTION**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **interface** defines the principles and processes that govern how  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yasaworks LLC operates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration requires compatibility. Client/s must either align
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the **interface** or implement an adapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **interface** is intentionally minimal, isolated, and direct.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, adapter implementation incurs little to no friction.

# DIRECT ENGAGEMENT ONLY
I am open to full-time or contract opportunities with direct employers only.

I no longer engage with staffing or intermediary companies.
All work arrangements must be directly with the hiring company.

# AT-WILL PREFERENCE
I prefer at-will employment or contracts with mutual termination rights.

Neither party should feel constrained by unnecessary legal or bureaucratic friction. Engagements should remain voluntary and value-driven at all times.
