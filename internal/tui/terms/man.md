interface(1)

**NAME**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Yasaworks LLC** - a single-member limited liability company
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emmanuel Yasa, Managing Member

**SYNOPSIS**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Yasaworks LLC [Terms][Operating Principles & Processes]**

**DESCRIPTION**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **interface** defines the terms, principles and processes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that govern how Yasaworks LLC operates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration requires compatibility. Client/s must either align
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the **interface** or implement an adapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **interface** is intentionally minimal, isolated, and direct.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, adapter implementation incurs little to no friction.

> Note: This page simply outlines my terms and how I generally work. 
> If it makes sense to you, then we're compatible. Ping me, and let's discuss.

# DIRECT AND REMOTE ENGAGEMENT ONLY
I am open to full-time or contract opportunities with direct employers only.  
All work arrangements must be directly with the hiring company.

I operate exclusively in a remote setup. I maintain a dedicated office space  
and have structured my professional life around remote-first execution.  
This setup is intentional and long term.

# AT-WILL ALIGNMENT
I favor at-will employment or contracts with mutual termination rights.

Engagements should remain voluntary and value-driven at all times. For context, 
I have maintained an at-will relationship with my current employer for over 
four years, consistently achieving 95%+ performance evaluations and opting to 
remain an individual contributor despite being offered a leadership position. 

Flexibility has ensured that both parties continue to receive the expected mutual value from the engagement.

# SERVICES PROVIDED AND APPROACH 
I provide backend development services focused on delivering maintainable and performant systems. 

Work is output-driven and autonomous. Clients are expected to provide and honor 
clear requirements and priorities. Clear, but not rigid. Pivots are expected 
and supported, as long as they remain within Client's decision and discretion.
