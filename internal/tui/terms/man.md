interface(1)

**NAME**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Yasaworks LLC** - a single-member limited liability company
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emmanuel Yasa, Managing Member

**SYNOPSIS**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Yasaworks LLC [Terms][Operating Principles & Processes]**

**DESCRIPTION**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **interface** defines the terms, principles and processes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that govern how Yasaworks LLC operates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration requires compatibility. Client/s must either align
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the **interface** or implement an adapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **interface** is intentionally minimal, isolated, and direct.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, adapter implementation incurs little to no friction.

> Note: This page simply outlines my terms and how I generally work. 
> If it makes sense to you, then we're compatible. Ping me, and let's discuss.

# DIRECT AND REMOTE ENGAGEMENT ONLY
I am open to full-time or contract opportunities with direct employers only.  
All work arrangements must be directly with the hiring company.

I operate exclusively in a remote setup. I maintain a dedicated office space  
and have structured my professional life around remote-first execution.  
This setup is intentional and long term.

# AT-WILL PREFERENCE
I prefer at-will employment or contracts with mutual termination rights.

Neither party should feel constrained by unnecessary legal or bureaucratic  
friction. Engagements should remain voluntary and value-driven at all times.
